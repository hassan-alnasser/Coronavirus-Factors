## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

If Anaconda distribution is not installed, then you will need to install below libraries on the top of python to be able to run notebooks:

    1. Pandas
    2. Numpy
    3. Matplotlib


## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

COVID-19 affects different people in different ways. In this project, I was interested in using the latest data on COVID-19 pandemic from ourworldindata.org to understand and find answers for:

    1. How the increase of Hospital Beds could help in reducing COVID-19 deaths?
    2. Will Handwashing Facilities existence improve COVID-19 control?
    3. How could diabetes prevalence increase the total deaths of COVID-19?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

In this repository, there is Covid.ipynb file available to showcase work related to the above questions. I provided the dataset link at the bottom of the page here to download. The dataset xlsx file needs to be in the same folder with the .ipynb files.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>
