## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

If Anaconda distribution is not installed, then you will need to install below libraries on the top of python to be able to run notebooks:

    1. Pandas
    2. Numpy
    3. Matplotlib


## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

COVID-19 affects different people in different ways. In this project, I was interested in using the latest data on COVID-19 pandemic from ourworldindata.org to understand and find answers for:

    1. How the increase of Hospital Beds could help in reducing COVID-19 deaths?
    2. Will Handwashing Facilities existence improve COVID-19 control?
    3. How could diabetes prevalence increase the total deaths of COVID-19?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

In this repository, there is Covid.ipynb file available to showcase work related to the above questions. Also, the dataset used has been provided. The dataset xlsx file needs to be in the same folder with the .ipynb file.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@hassan.0.alnasser/risk-factors-of-covid-19-death-98adbb9600aa).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

The major credit goes to ourworldindata.org for providing the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the ourworldindata link available [here](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-data). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
